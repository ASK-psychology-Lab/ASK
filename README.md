## 👋 Welcome to ASK Lab!
ASK Lab focuses on studying psychological constructs such as authenticity, self-knowledge, true self, existential meaning, free will, and hope. We aim to answer the following questions:
- What defines the true self and authenticity?
- How does the belief in free will and a sense of meaning impact human behavior?

If you're interested in our research or joining the lab, feel free to contact us!
